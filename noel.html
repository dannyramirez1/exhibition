					The reason I choose the images I did for the subject I interviewed, being my dad, was because these were some of the things he always talked about, listened to, and just seeing how he cared about his whole family. The image I choose for the historical moment was a picture of Ronald Reagan and the day that he almost got assassinated because the year where he almost got assassinated was the year of 1981 and that was the same year where my dad gave his personal historical event where he met his future best friend his 8th grade teacher. The picture I made the largest was the picture of my dad so you know the portrait was of him and that it would be the first thing people see. Then all the other pictures I tried to make the same size because I feel everything in my interviewees self portrait is equally important. However some of the pictures that related to each other I tried to blend together almost as if in one category for example baseball where he had his favorite players and teams. Then the background I used was for spirituality so everything could have almost as a natural feel when I blended the pictures to the background.
