					<center>This is my digital portfolio that I created using HTML and CSS code to showcase all my the projects we did in each class. For Daramola's class, we had to interview someone older than us and transcribe the interview and create a map of all the places they visited for our coding the past project. For Noel's coding the past portion of the project we had to make self-portrait collages using photoshops to describe the person we interviewed and us we also a story about the person we interviewed and connected it to a bigger problem. For the Timely Solution portion of Noel, we created poems using articles and images to inspire us and once we did that we made a collage to represent the poem, picture, and poem. Then we finished with writing an artist statement reflection. Last, for Daramola's part of the Timely Solution project, we were given a revolutionary item that was created during the industrial revolution and made a sketch, 3D object, research and a presentation for the object we were given. </center>
