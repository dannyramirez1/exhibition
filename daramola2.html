				The first article, Alfred Bird: Egg-free custard inventor and chemist I read is talking about the person who invented baking powder. The person who discovers baking powder was Alfred Bird and he was also the person who discovered custard before he had discovered baking powder. When he discovered baking powder he discovered it almost by accident not doing any research on how to make it but, looking for a safer alternative to using yeast to bake because his wife was allergic to it and that’s how he discovered baking powder. He also discovered custard on accident also because his wife was also allergic to eggs so he discovered two items by accident and not doing much research on it.  Now we have a new way to bake goods from this invention and we use baking powder in our everyday lives like in bread or any baked good like muffins, bagels, and cookies. Baking powder and Baking Soda are almost the same but, have different bases and Baking powder can react to just pure water, while baking soda only reacts to liquids like vinegar and lemon juice. Baking powder seeming to be the stronger of the two that is why most baking powders say double acting because they are stronger. To think that this was created by accident where would we be without its invention. Thanks to Alfred Bird we don’t have to worry. Alfred Bird lived from 1811- December 5, 1878.

				For our 3D model, we decided to create a volcano to represent our Baking Powder because everyone knows about the baking soda volcano but, what some people may not know is that baking powder contains baking soda in it so it doesn't need an acid to react like baking soda does. All you need for the baking powder to react is water and heat so we'll be put boiling water to erupt the volcano to show the baking powder works. We will also be baking cookies with baking powder to show that without baking powder you wouldn't be able to bake goods like bread, cookies, and cake.

				In 2018, we can do amazing things with our technology – cars run on electricity; we can manipulate genetic material; we can have real-time video conversations with people in the world’s most remote regions. But we didn’t just arrive at all of this new and dynamic technology.The Industrial Revolution of the 18th-19th Centuries laid the foundation for the luxuries that we enjoy today. In your time traveling group, you will go back in time and research an Industrial-era technology that has influenced our world today, and present what you found at the 1851 Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, aka the first World’s Fair Expo.
