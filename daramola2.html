								For our 3D model, we decided to create a volcano to represent our Baking Powder because everyone knows about the baking soda volcano but, what some people may not know is that baking powder contains baking soda in it so it doesn't need an acid to react like baking soda does. All you need for the baking powder to react is water and heat so we'll be put boiling water to erupt the volcano to show the baking powder works. We will also be baking cookies with baking powder to show that without baking powder you wouldn't be able to bake goods like bread, cookies, and cake.

				In 2018, we can do amazing things with our technology – cars run on electricity; we can manipulate genetic material; we can have real-time video conversations with people in the world’s most remote regions. But we didn’t just arrive at all of this new and dynamic technology.The Industrial Revolution of the 18th-19th Centuries laid the foundation for the luxuries that we enjoy today. In your time traveling group, you will go back in time and research an Industrial-era technology that has influenced our world today, and present what you found at the 1851 Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, aka the first World’s Fair Expo.
